# Description
A web application for managing real estate offers. The application was developed using Laravel and MySQL on the backend side and Angular on the frontend side. The application is dedicated to users looking for real estate and users having real estate to sell or rent. Users can browse and filter offers without creating an account or logging into the app, but only logged-in system users can add and manage offers. Logged-in users can use the communication module, follow offers, and have access to their account management. During the registration, the user has the option to create a private or business account (e.g., for a real estate office). A user with a business account can add new accounts to the system (for company employees) and manage them.
